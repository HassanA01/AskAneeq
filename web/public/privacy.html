    <p>AskAneeq is a personal ChatGPT app that lets you learn about Aneeq Hassan — his experience, projects, skills, and availability. This policy explains what data is collected when you use the app.</p>

    <h2>What We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you interact with AskAneeq, the app may log the following anonymized data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The tool or category you queried (e.g., "experience", "projects")</li>
      <li>A timestamp of the request</li>
      <li>The message you typed, if provided to the analytics tool</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored in a private SQLite database on the server and is used solely to understand how the app is being used.</p>

    <h2>What We Don't Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect your name, email address, IP address, or any other identifying information. We do not use cookies or tracking pixels. We do not share any data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Analytics data is retained indefinitely on the server but is never shared publicly or sold.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app may link to <a href="https://calendly.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calendly</a> for scheduling. Calendly's own privacy policy applies when you use their service.</p>
